        Hydrogen Line Telescope

      <div class="info">
        Since I started experimentation with SDR recievers in early 2020,
        I've always wanted to build my own radio telescope for things like pulsar detection
        and recieiving data from SpaceX Falcon 9 second stages,
        and I've finally started taking steps in that direction by doing something a little simpler -
        detecting the microwave radiation emitted by neutral hydrogen atoms undergoing a
        spin-flip transition in our milky way.
